"It actually looks like there has not been that radical development on the chat systems during the last decade. I find that surprising given all the areas where improvements could be made." - Jarkko Oikarinen, Inventor Of IRC

Try to do what IRC founder said and improve chat. Really improve.

New features not found in IRC Protocol:

* persistent log with buffer replay

* send multiple lines in a message, no need for Pastie/Gist/PasteBin/etc

* lack of slash commands

* send anything, handle can be anything too
