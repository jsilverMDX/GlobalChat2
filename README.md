GlobalChat 2

modern chat experiment

goal: build a better (than IRC!) chat for enterprise and coders in 100% ruby

see: design ideals document on wiki

simplistic protocol, only 12 commands

"It actually looks like there has not been that radical development on the chat systems during the last decade. I find that surprising given all the areas where improvements could be made." - Jarkko Oikarinen, Inventor Of IRC

This codebase is the result of applying the principle of Monozukuri to this ancient technology.

easy wins so far not present in traditional IRC:

* autoscrollback+logsaving

* multiline pasting in a single line

* tons (millions) of useless "features" removed from IRC not useful to everday productivity
